TimeAlarm by @7654jp

This program was made to be used in two ways:
1. Startup launch : call this program with "-OnStartUp"
2. User launch : call this program with "-OnUserCall"

Usage:
Add this app to task scheduler to launch when the user logined.

This program will be updated VERY SLOWLY.

Feel free to ask me to add new feature(s).
