TimeAlarm by yoshi-jp @7654jp

Version 1.6.1

This program was made to be used in two ways:
1. Launch by startup : place a shortcut with "-OnStartUp"
2. Launch by user : place a shortcut with "-OnUserCall"

This program will not be updated anymore.
Reason:
I don't have any feature to add.
I'm busy than before.

Feel free to ask me to add new feature(s).
